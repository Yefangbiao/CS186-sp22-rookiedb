Introduction to Database Systems

---
Hello, here is my CS186 learning record warehouse

The purpose of CS186 is to implement a simple transactional database.

It supports sequential execution of simple transactions. In the job, it is required to implement B+ tree indexes, efficient join algorithms, query optimization, multi-granularity locking to allow concurrent execution of transactions and support for database recovery.

Learning Prerequisites: Knowledge of database related knowledge. If you don't have knowledge about databases, you may have a big learning barrier.

Book Recommendations (Official Book Recommendations):

《**[Database Systems Concepts](https://www.db-book.com/)**》

《**[Database Management Systems](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dbbook/)**》

[Course homepage](https://cs186berkeley.net/): The content of the course homepage is very rich, and you can also find previous content. Please read through the entire content of the course homepage.

[pdf](https://github.com/Yefangbiao/CS186-study/tree/main/pdf): Student permission is required to get pdf. But there is no big difference in the pdf of each version, I use the [2020 fall pdf](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1zUUR-MJU_CPRjnox4sp06f1yZK8BjLni) (the link may expire). I made a copy and put it in the repository.

[note](https://github.com/Yefangbiao/CS186-study/tree/main/note): In fact, you can learn all the relevant knowledge points by using various built-in notes, which are quite complete. You can find it on the course homepage (open for download). **I think notes are pretty good as review material**

[project](https://github.com/berkeley-cs186/sp22-rookiedb/): I use the official sp22 code repository, but it may be updated every year. [Project official introduction](https://cs186.gitbook.io/project/) may also be updated every year.

video: Usually only the latest courses have official videos, you need to watch the corresponding videos by clicking on the course schedule `youtube`. Usually, only the latest teaching issue will have a video.
